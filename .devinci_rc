#! /bin/bash
# .devinci_rc
#
# This script serves as the main configuration file for the Devinci system.
# It is designed to be sourced into the user's shell session to apply custom
# environment settings, aliases, and other configurations.
#
# Usage:
#   Source this script in your shell initialization file (e.g., .bashrc):
#     source ~/.devinci_rc
#
#   Once sourced, it will load custom environment variables, define aliases,
#   and apply other configurations defined in this script.
#
# Important:
#   Make sure not to directly modify this script. Instead, modify configuration
#   files located in the registration.d directory. After making changes, run the
#   update.sh script to apply the modifications.
#
# Note:
#   This script also sources the aliases.sh file if it exists in the user's
#   home directory. Make sure to create and manage your aliases in the
#   aliases.sh file for easier maintenance.
# Check if .devinci_rc exists before sourcing
#if [ -f ~/.devinci_rc ]; then
#    source ~/.devinci_rc
