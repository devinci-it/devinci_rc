# path.sh
#
# This script serves as the central repository for defining custom paths in the Devinci system.
# Custom paths are used to specify additional directories containing executable files or resources.
#
# Usage:
#   Do not directly modify this script. It is automatically generated from the path.ini file
#   located in the registration.d directory. To update custom paths, follow these steps:
#   1. Modify the path.ini file in the registration.d directory to add, remove, or modify paths.
#   2. Run the update.sh script to generate the updated path.sh file and apply the changes.
#
# Important:
#   Do not directly modify this script. Any changes made directly to this script will be overwritten
#   the next time the update.sh script is run. Instead, modify the path.ini file and run the update.sh
#   script to apply the changes.
#
# Note:
#   The path.ini file follows a specific format. Each section represents a custom path, with the
#   path name enclosed in square brackets ([]). Within each section, specify the value of the path,
#   along with its description, absolute path, and priority value.
#   Comments in the .ini file are indicated by a ';' symbol.
#   Example:
#     ; [CUSTOM_PATH]
#     ; description = Brief description of the custom path
#     ; name = CUSTOM_PATH
#     ; absolute_path = /path/to/directory
#     ; priority = 10
