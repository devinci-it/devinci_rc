; Environment Configuration File

; This file allows you to define custom environment variables for use in your shell.

; Each entry consists of three properties:
;   - description: A brief description of the entry.
;   - name: The name of the environment variable.
;   - value: The value associated with the environment variable.

; Guidelines:
; - Follow a consistent naming convention for variables (e.g., UPPER_CASE).
; - Provide descriptive comments for each entry to aid understanding.
; - Keep entries organized and grouped logically.
; - Avoid duplicating standard or system-defined environment variables.
; - Ensure values are properly formatted and quoted as necessary.

; Common Conventions:
; - Use underscores (_) to separate words in variable names for readability.
; - Prefix custom variables with project or organization initials to avoid conflicts.
; - Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose or context of the variable.
; - Use all uppercase letters for variable names to distinguish them from shell commands or other entities.
; - Use quotes around values if they contain spaces or special characters to ensure proper interpretation.

; To define an environment variable, use the following format:
;
; [VariableName]
; description = Brief description of the variable
; name = VariableName
; value = Value of the environment variable
;
; For example:
;
; [PATH_TO_SCRIPTS]
; description = Path to custom scripts directory
; name = PATH_TO_SCRIPTS
; value = /path/to/scripts

[EXAMPLE_VARIABLE]
description = Example environment variable
name = EXAMPLE_VARIABLE
value = example_value
