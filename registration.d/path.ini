; Path Configuration File

; This file allows you to define custom paths for use in your shell's PATH variable.

; Each entry consists of four properties:
;   - description: A brief description of the entry.
;   - name: The name of the custom path.
;   - absolute_path: The absolute path associated with the custom path.
;   - priority: The priority of the path entry (higher priority values are added to PATH first).

; Guidelines:
; - Provide descriptive comments for each entry to aid understanding.
; - Keep entries organized and grouped logically.
; - Ensure absolute paths are properly formatted and quoted as necessary.
; - Avoid duplicate or conflicting path names.
; - Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose or context of the path.

; To define a custom path, use the following format:
;
; [PathName]
; description = Brief description of the custom path
; name = PathName
; absolute_path = Absolute path associated with the custom path
; priority = Priority value for the path entry (higher values are added first)
;
; For example:
;
; [CUSTOM_PYTHON_PATH]
; description = Custom Python binary path
; name = CUSTOM_PYTHON_PATH
; absolute_path = /path/to/custom/python/bin
; priority = 10

[CUSTOM_PYTHON_PATH]
description = Custom Python binary path
name = CUSTOM_PYTHON_PATH
absolute_path = /path/to/custom/python/bin
priority = 10

[CUSTOM_NODEJS_PATH]
description = Custom Node.js binary path
name = CUSTOM_NODEJS_PATH
absolute_path = /path/to/custom/nodejs/bin
priority = 5

[CUSTOM_UTILS_PATH]
description = Custom utilities path
name = CUSTOM_UTILS_PATH
absolute_path = /path/to/custom/utils/bin
priority = 20
